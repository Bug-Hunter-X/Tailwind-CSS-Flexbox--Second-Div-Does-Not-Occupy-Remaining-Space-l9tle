```javascript
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4"></div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a flexbox layout with two divs. However, the second div does not occupy the remaining space, even though it's a flex item. This is because the default flex-grow value of flex items is 0. To make the second div occupy the remaining space, we need to add the `flex-grow` class.
